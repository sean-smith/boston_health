# Is Boston Healthy

The city of Boston maintains an open data initiative that provides datasets on lots of different city services https://data.cityofboston.gov/.

We both have experience taking large amounts of data and making conclusions based on trends and correlations between different datasets. Based on Viviana's experience in Andrei Lapet's Data Mechanics Course and Sean's experience with New York City Taxi data and geographical zone information we've decided to look at Boston obesity data and locations of nutrition centers and the distance between them. 

Specifically we want to model MBTA transportation options from different neighborhoods (for which we're able to calculate the obesity rate) to nutrition centers. We aim to model the distance in order to answer our hypothesis "Do neighborhoods further from nutrition centers suffer from greater obesity rates?".
